# Random Forest Learning Tool

This project focuses on understanding the **Random Forest algorithm** and how it improves performance over individual decision trees.

## Objective
To learn how Random Forest works by combining multiple decision trees and reducing overfitting through randomness and ensembling.

## Concepts Covered
- Decision Trees vs Random Forest
- Ensemble learning
- Bootstrap sampling
- Feature randomness
- Bias–variance tradeoff

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Train a baseline Decision Tree model  
3. Train a Random Forest model  
4. Compare performance and behavior  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
This project helps build a strong conceptual understanding of why Random Forests are more robust and generalize better than single decision trees.
